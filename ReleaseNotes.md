The LogicalDOC development team is proud to announce the availability of LogicalDOC CE 8.6.1

You can get this distribution in various formats from the LD's website:
https://www.logicaldoc.com/download-logicaldoc-community 

LogicalDOC Community Edition is free (libre) software (FLOSS) and allows organizations and individuals to centralize the management, storage, retrieval and distribution of documents.

LogicalDoc Community Edition offers a lot for your document management needs with a multilingual, 
desktop interface and user-friendly features such as multilingual full-text indexing, full version control, task manager, 
importing from zip files, and document searching to keep control of your documents.

LogicalDOC is localized in many languages: Russian, English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Italian and many others and one of its most interesting features is its ability to index the content of documents using different algorithms depending on the language of the document.
This allows later to perform "smart" full-text searches.

LogicalDOC Community provides a set of SOAP and REST API interfaces that allow the system to be integrated with other applications
The web-service API documentation is available in the LogicalDOC Documentation website https://docs.logicaldoc.com/en/web-services-api

In addition, a WebDAV and a CMIS interface are available.
Native apps for Android and iOS are published and available for free download on Google Play and iTunes.

There are many updates in this version 8.5.2, both in terms of performance and system stability, but the most relevant updates are those that have been made on the WebDAV interface.
